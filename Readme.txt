Readme for the NetViewer

To run the program as an application:
1. Extract all files from NetViewer.zip.
2. Open a dos window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
3. Run the program with the following command:

	...\your_directory>java NetViewer


To run the program as an applet, double click on applet.html.

Note: The source code is also included in the zipped folder (see the .java files). If you make any changes, you can recompile the code with

	...\your_directory>javac *.java
	
Be sure to set the classpath first. Here is one way to do it:

	set path=c:\program files\j2sdk1.4.1_02\bin;%path%

(Change it if the path to the bin directory is different in your system.)
